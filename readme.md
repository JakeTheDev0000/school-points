# school milestones

this is a GUI for school milestones

idk what else to put here

    ### Language: python   ###

    ### Path: src\main.py  ###

to run the program, type:

    python3 src\main.py 

# command line arguments

    python3 src\main.py -CMD : gets into the CMD version

    python3 src\main.py --help : gets the help menu

    python3 src\main.py --version : gets the version of the program

    python3 src\main.py --soundOn : runs the program with sound on

    python3 src\main.py --soundOff : runs the program with sound off

ps. in github you might see commits called "last known version %Program-version%-%Dev-Version%"

well it grabs the **latest** version (even if its not working) and pushes it to git hub, so no work can be corrupted
